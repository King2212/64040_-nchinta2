This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
library(factoextra)
library(tidyverse)
library(cluster)
```

```{r}
'Pharmaceuticals.(1)' <- read.csv("C:/Users/Kittu Varma/Downloads/Pharmaceuticals (1).csv")
head(`Pharmaceuticals.(1)`)
colSums(is.na(`Pharmaceuticals.(1)`)) # verify sum of the null columns in the Pharmaceuticals data
```

#Question A. Use only the numerical variables (1 to 9) to cluster the 21 firms. Justify the various choices made in conducting the cluster analysis, such as weights for different variables, the specific clustering algorithm(s)

```{r}
`Pharmaceuticals.(1)_numerical` <- `Pharmaceuticals.(1)`[,c(3:11)] #numerical variable from 3 to 11
#Normalization 
normal_data <- as.data.frame(scale(`Pharmaceuticals.(1)_numerical`))
distance <- get_dist(normal_data)
fviz_dist(distance) #visualise a distance matrix
# Estimating the no.of clusters
# Elbow Method is used in scaleing the data to determine the value of k
fviz_nbclust(normal_data, FUNcluster = kmeans, method = "wss") + labs(subtitle = "Elbow Method")
# Silhouette Method is used in scaling thw data to determine the number of clusters
fviz_nbclust(normal_data,FUNcluster = kmeans,method = "silhouette")+labs(subtitle="Silhouette Method")
#data clusters
set.seed(12336)
k5 <- kmeans(normal_data, center = 5, nstart = 25) # where k = 5
k5$centers #centriods
fviz_cluster(k5, data = normal_data) #cluster plot viz
k5$size
#K-Means Cluster Analysis - Fitting the data with 5 clusters
data_fitting <- kmeans(normal_data, 5)
aggregate(normal_data, by = list(data_fitting$cluster), FUN = mean)
norm_data <- as.data.frame(normal_data, data_fitting$cluster)
norm_data
```

#Question B.Interpret the clusters with respect to the numerical variables used in forming the clusters
```{r}
#cluster 1 - Row 9, 6, 12
#cluster 2 - Row 3, 18
#cluster 3 - Row 6, 9, 14, 20
#cluster 4 - Row 2, 4, 7, 10, 16, 19, 21
#cluster 5 - Row 11, 13, 15, 17
#After executing the function::  
aggregate(normal_data, by = list(data_fitting$cluster), FUN = mean)
#following are the observations:
  
# Highest Market Cap, highest ROE, highest ROA, lowest Leverage and lowest Beta, belongs to cluster 1
#cluster 2 has lowest Beta, lowest PE Ratio
#Lowest Market Cap, highest Beta, highest Leverage, highest Rev Growth, lowest PE ratio belongs to cluster 3
#cluster 4 has highest PE Ratio, lowest ROE, lowest ROA, lowest Net Profit Margin
#Highest Asset Turnover, lowest Revenue growth, highest Net Profit Margin belongs to cluster 5
#cluster plot
clusplot(normal_data, data_fitting$cluster, color = TRUE, shade =TRUE, labels = 2, lines = 0)
```

#Question C.Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variables (10 to 12)? (those not used in forming the clusters) 
```{r}
#Strong buy, hold, and moderate buy recommendations
#Although Cluster 1 has the best ROE, ROA, and Market Cap, Rev Growth does not suggest a mild sell.
#Cluster 2 has lowest Beta, lowest Asset_Turnover so hold Recommendation
#Cluster 3 has highest Beta, highest Leverage, highest Rev_Growth so it is a  strong one to buy Recommendation
#The recommendation to buy Cluster 4 is to hold because it has the highest PE ratio, the lowest ROE, ROA, and the lowest net profit margin
##Cluster 5 has highest Asset_Turnover, highest Net_Profit_Margin, lowest revenue growth so it has a little risk but it is to buy Recommendation
##Cluster 5 and Cluster 3 "moderate to buy Recommendation"
#Cluster 1,4 is "hold Recommendation"
```

#Question D.Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset. 

```{r}
#Cluster 1  -  Risky but high revenue
#Cluster 2  - on hold 
#Cluster 3  - moderate buy recomendation
#Cluster 4  - on hold recommendation
#Cluster 5  - strong buy recommendation
#These are the appropriate names 

#Thank you
